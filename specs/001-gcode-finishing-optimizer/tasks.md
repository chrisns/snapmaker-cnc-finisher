# Tasks: GCode Finishing Pass Optimizer

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-gcode-finishing-optimizer/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), spec.md (complete), research.md (complete), data-model.md (complete), contracts/ (complete)

**Tests**: This feature uses Test-Driven Development (TDD) per Constitution Principle III (NON-NEGOTIABLE). All test tasks are MANDATORY and must be completed BEFORE implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Per plan.md, this is a single binary CLI tool:
- Source: `internal/` (private packages), `cmd/gcode-optimizer/` (main entry point)
- Tests: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`
- Root: `go.mod`, `README.md`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create project directory structure: `cmd/gcode-optimizer/`, `internal/{parser,optimizer,writer,progress}/`, `tests/{unit,integration,integration/fixtures}/`
- [X] T002 Initialize Go module in go.mod with `module github.com/chrisns/snapmaker-cnc-finisher`
- [X] T003 [P] Add dependency `github.com/256dpi/gcode v0.3.0` to go.mod
- [X] T004 [P] Create README.md with basic project description and installation instructions

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T010 [P] Implement OptimizationStrategy enum (Conservative, Aggressive) in internal/optimizer/optimizer.go
- [X] T011 [P] Implement IntersectionPoint struct in internal/optimizer/optimizer.go
- [X] T012 [P] Implement OptimizationResult struct in internal/progress/progress.go

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Basic GCode Optimization (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Optimize finishing pass GCode by removing redundant shallow cutting operations, supporting both conservative and aggressive strategies, handling threshold-crossing moves correctly.

**Independent Test**: Provide freya-subset.cnc and 1.0mm allowance, verify output has fewer lines and correct move filtering/splitting based on strategy.

### Tests for User Story 1 (TDD - MANDATORY) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Goal**: Provide real-time progress updates during optimization showing lines processed, ETA, and final statistics including time savings.

**Independent Test**: Run tool on large test file (freya-subset.cnc duplicated 10x), observe console progress updates every 2 seconds OR 10k lines, verify final statistics display.

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently - optimization works with visible progress

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Error Handling (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Provide clear, actionable error messages for invalid inputs (missing files, bad allowance, invalid strategy, unparseable GCode).

**Independent Test**: Run tool with various invalid inputs, verify error messages match specification and tool exits with non-zero code.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion (T001-T006) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion (T007-T012)
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete (T013-T070)

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 (integrates with optimization pipeline but doesn't modify core logic)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1/US2 (adds validation layer, doesn't modify optimization or progress)

### Within Each User Story (TDD Workflow)

1. **Tests FIRST** - Write all test tasks for the story, verify they FAIL
2. **Foundational types** - Implement structs/enums (can be parallel)
3. **Core functions** - Implement parsing, classification, optimization logic (sequential due to dependencies)
4. **Integration** - Wire into main CLI pipeline
5. **Verify tests PASS** - All tests for the story should now pass

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase (T001-T006)**:
- T003, T004, T005, T006 can all run in parallel after T001-T002

**Foundational Phase (T007-T012)**:
- T009, T010, T011, T012 can all run in parallel after T007-T008

**User Story 1 Tests (T013-T023)**:
- All test tasks can be launched in parallel (different test files/functions)

**User Story 1 Implementation**:
- T024, T025 (parser functions) can run in parallel
- T029 (optimizer creation) can run in parallel with parser tasks
- T034 (writer) can run in parallel with optimizer tasks

**User Story 2 Tests (T040-T043)**:
- All test tasks can run in parallel

**User Story 2 Implementation**:
- T044, T048 can run in parallel (different structs)

**User Story 3 Tests (T055-T060)**:
- All test tasks can run in parallel

**Polish Phase (T071-T092)**:
- T071, T072, T073 (CI/CD) can run in parallel
- T074, T075, T076 (documentation/help) can run in parallel
- T077, T078, T079 (linting/testing) can run in parallel
- T081, T082, T083 (test fixtures) can run in parallel
- T084, T085, T086 (smoke tests) can run in parallel on different platforms

**Cross-Story Parallelization**:
- Once Foundational completes, ALL user stories (US1, US2, US3) can start in parallel with different developers

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (TDD)

### Step 1: Launch all tests in parallel (verify they FAIL)

```bash
# Run all User Story 1 unit tests together:
Task T013: "Unit test for header parsing in tests/unit/parser_test.go"
Task T014: "Unit test for modal state initialization in tests/unit/parser_test.go"
Task T015: "Unit test for modal state updates in tests/unit/parser_test.go"
Task T016: "Unit test for ScanMinZ in tests/unit/parser_test.go"
Task T017: "Unit test for ClassifyMove in tests/unit/optimizer_test.go"
Task T018: "Unit test for CalculateIntersection in tests/unit/move_test.go"
Task T019: "Unit test for SplitMove in tests/unit/move_test.go"
Task T020: "Unit test for ShouldPreserve in tests/unit/optimizer_test.go"

# Run all User Story 1 integration tests together:
Task T021: "Integration test for end-to-end optimization (aggressive) in tests/integration/cli_test.go"
Task T022: "Integration test for end-to-end optimization (conservative) in tests/integration/cli_test.go"
Task T023: "Integration test for 3-axis vs 4-axis detection in tests/integration/cli_test.go"

# Expected: All tests should FAIL (not yet implemented)
```

### Step 2: Implement foundational structures in parallel

```bash
Task T024: "Implement ParseFile in internal/parser/parser.go"
Task T025: "Implement parseHeader in internal/parser/parser.go"
Task T029: "Implement NewOptimizer in internal/optimizer/optimizer.go"
Task T034: "Implement Writer.WriteFile in internal/writer/writer.go"
```

### Step 3: Implement core logic sequentially (dependencies)

```bash
# Sequential due to dependencies:
Task T026 ‚Üí T027 ‚Üí T028 (parser functions depend on each other)
Task T030 ‚Üí T031 ‚Üí T032 ‚Üí T033 (optimizer functions depend on each other)
Task T035 ‚Üí T036 ‚Üí T037 ‚Üí T038 ‚Üí T039 (CLI integration pipeline)
```

### Step 4: Verify all tests PASS

```bash
go test ./tests/unit/... -v
go test ./tests/integration/... -v
# Expected: All User Story 1 tests should now PASS
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T006)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T007-T012) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T013-T039)
   - Write tests first (T013-T023), verify FAIL
   - Implement (T024-T039), verify tests PASS
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently with freya.cnc
5. Deploy/demo if ready (basic optimization works)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP! ‚úÖ)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (with progress! ‚úÖ)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (with error handling! ‚úÖ)
5. Add Polish ‚Üí Final release v1.0.0 üéâ

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Week 1**: Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T012)
2. **Week 2-3**: Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T013-T039)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T040-T054) - can start early, integrates later
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T055-T070) - can start early, integrates later
3. **Week 4**: Integration and Polish (T071-T092)
4. Stories complete and integrate independently without conflicts

## Test Coverage Requirements (Constitution Principle III)

Per the project constitution, comprehensive testing is NON-NEGOTIABLE:

- **TDD Workflow**: Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor strictly enforced
- **Unit Tests**: All exported functions in internal/* packages
- **Integration Tests**: CLI workflows, file I/O, end-to-end optimization
- **Contract Tests**: Internal package interfaces (parser, optimizer, writer, progress)
- **Platform Tests**: CI must pass on macOS, Linux, Windows before merge
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage; uncovered code requires justification

**Test Task Counts**:
- User Story 1: 11 test tasks (T013-T023)
- User Story 2: 4 test tasks (T040-T043)
- User Story 3: 6 test tasks (T055-T060)
- Total: 21 test tasks (23% of all implementation tasks)

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **TDD workflow**: Tests MUST fail before implementation, then pass after
- **Constitution compliance**: Every task aligns with project principles (cross-platform, static binary, Go best practices, comprehensive testing)
- **File paths**: All absolute paths from repository root for clarity
- **Commit strategy**: Commit after each task or logical group (e.g., all tests for a story)
- **Stop at any checkpoint**: Validate story independently before proceeding
- **Avoid**: Vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

---

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 93 (including setup, foundational, 3 user stories, polish)

**Tasks per Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 6 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 6 tasks
- Phase 3 (US1 - Basic Optimization): 27 tasks (11 tests + 16 implementation)
- Phase 4 (US2 - Progress Monitoring): 15 tasks (4 tests + 11 implementation)
- Phase 5 (US3 - Error Handling): 16 tasks (6 tests + 10 implementation)
- Phase 6 (Polish): 23 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- 43 tasks marked [P] (46% can run in parallel given proper sequencing)
- All 3 user stories can proceed in parallel after Foundational phase
- All tests within a user story can run in parallel

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Run on freya-subset.cnc with 1mm allowance, verify line reduction and correct move filtering
- US2: Run on large test file, observe progress updates every 2s or 10k lines
- US3: Test with invalid inputs, verify error messages match spec

**Suggested MVP Scope**: User Story 1 only (39 tasks total including setup/foundational) = Basic working optimizer
