# Changelog

All notable changes to the GCode Finishing Pass Optimizer will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-26

### Added
- Initial release of GCode Finishing Pass Optimizer
- Core optimization functionality:
  - Parse Snapmaker Luban GCode files
  - Extract header metadata (bounding box, line count, 4-axis detection)
  - Track modal state for X, Y, Z, B, F coordinates
  - Calculate depth threshold (min_z + allowance)
  - Classify moves as Shallow, Deep, CrossingEnter, CrossingLeave
  - Remove shallow cutting moves already handled by rough cut
  - Preserve deep finishing moves
  - Support for 3-axis and 4-axis CNC configurations

- Two optimization strategies:
  - Conservative: Preserves entire moves that cross threshold (safer)
  - Aggressive: Splits moves at threshold intersection using parametric linear interpolation (maximum optimization)

- Progress monitoring:
  - Real-time progress updates (every 2 seconds OR 10,000 lines)
  - ETA calculation when total line count is known
  - Processing throughput display (lines/second)

- Comprehensive statistics display:
  - Depth analysis (Min Z, Threshold, Allowance)
  - Processing summary (Lines removed/preserved/split with percentages)
  - Output metrics (File size reduction)
  - Performance metrics (Processing time, Throughput)

- Error handling:
  - File existence validation
  - Allowance value validation (numeric, non-negative)
  - Strategy flag validation (conservative|aggressive)
  - Clear, actionable error messages
  - Graceful handling of missing/malformed headers

- CLI features:
  - `--force` flag to skip output file overwrite confirmation
  - `--strategy` flag to choose optimization approach
  - `--version` flag to display version information
  - `--help` flag with usage examples

- Build and distribution:
  - Cross-platform support (macOS Intel/ARM, Windows, Linux)
  - Static binary compilation (CGO_ENABLED=0)
  - GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
  - Automated release builds for all platforms

### Technical Details
- Written in Go 1.21
- Uses `github.com/256dpi/gcode v0.3.0` for GCode parsing
- Modal state machine for coordinate tracking
- Parametric linear interpolation for move splitting (4 decimal precision)
- In-memory processing (handles up to 10M line files)
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- Quickstart guide with real-world examples
- Troubleshooting section
- API contracts documentation for internal packages

### Performance
- Processes typical files at 300,000+ lines/second
- Time savings: 20%+ reduction in machining time (typical)
- File size reduction: 15-40% (typical for 0.5-2.0mm allowances)

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-26

### Added
- G0 rapid positioning move optimization: Tool now optimizes both G0 (rapid positioning) and G1 (linear feed) moves based on depth threshold, providing additional cycle time reduction by eliminating unnecessary rapid moves in shallow zones

### Changed
- Updated parser `ScanMinZ()` to scan both G0 and G1 commands when determining minimum Z value
- Updated main optimization loop to process G0 moves through the same depth-based classification logic as G1 moves
- Updated error messages to reflect "G0/G1 moves" instead of just "G1 cutting moves"

### Technical Details
- G0 rapid moves are now subject to the same shallow/deep/crossing classification as G1 moves
- Both conservative and aggressive strategies apply to G0 moves
- G0 moves crossing the threshold are split using the same parametric linear interpolation as G1 moves
- G0 moves do not use feed rates, so time savings calculation remains unchanged (G1-based only)
